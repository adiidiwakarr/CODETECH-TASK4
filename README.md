## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
### PROJECT: COMPUTER VISION TASK

### OBJECTIVES : The objective of this project is to create a Python program that can classify images into different categories using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 mode. (I HAVE USED CAR IMAGE AS AN EXAMPLE)

### This project involves the following steps:

**Install the required libraries:** tensorflow,pillow,matplotlib

**Load and preprocess the image:** Use Pillow to load the image,Resize the image to the target size required by MobileNetV2 (224x224 pixels),Convert the image to a numpy array,Preprocess the image using the preprocess_input function from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2

**Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model:** Load the MobileNetV2 model with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset

**Classify the image:** Use the model to predict the class of the image ,Decode the predictions to human-readable labels using the decode_predictions function

**Display the image and classification results:** Display the input image using Matplotlib ,Print the top 3 predicted classes along with their probabilities

## RESULT
The script will display the input image.
It will print the top 3 predicted classes with their probabilities.



 ##NOTE 
 CHANGE IMG_PATH=r"   "
 with your image path to import it in code.
